# ReactLoginForm
This is a Fullstack Homework assignment requested by Availity. The objective was to create a registration form that allows user to electronically join Availity.

# 5: "For frontend engineer: Healthcare providers request to be part of the Availity system. Using React framework, create a registration user interface so healthcare providers can eletronically join Availity. The following data points should be collected: First and Last name, NPI number, Buiness Address, Telephone Number, and Email address"

I created a registration form for Availity made completely out of React.js. It takes in 5 inputs from the user, Full name, NPI number, Buisness Address, Telephone number, and email address. When you press submit it console logs the values inside the browser. Inside the handleChange component is where a post request would go using axios, to create an auth system. I also created a seperate repo <a href="https://github.com/dderrickmatheww/ReactLoginForm">here</a> for the react code exclusivly.
